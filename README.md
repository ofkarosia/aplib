## Acknowledgements / Inspiration

This Rust port's implementation logic was primarily guided by the original C decompression implementation of aPLib (`depacks.c`), and also significantly informed by the existing [Python port](https://github.com/snemes/aplib) by [Sandor Nemes](https://github.com/snemes). We acknowledge the efforts of the Python port's author in making the aPLib algorithm accessible in Python.
